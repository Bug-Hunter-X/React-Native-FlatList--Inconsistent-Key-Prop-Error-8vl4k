This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to the items being rendered.  The key prop must be unique for each item in the data array. If you're using an object, it may be generating the same key for multiple objects if you are using an object property that is not unique. This can cause unexpected behavior like incorrect rendering, item duplication, or performance issues. This error is sometimes difficult to detect because the error message isn't always clear.
