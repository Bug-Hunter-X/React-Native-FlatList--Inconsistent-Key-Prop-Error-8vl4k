This repository demonstrates a common but elusive bug in React Native's FlatList component:  the use of inconsistent or non-unique keys. The `FlatListBug.js` file shows the problematic code, leading to incorrect rendering and potential performance degradation. The solution, in `FlatListBugSolution.js`, provides a corrected implementation using unique keys, effectively resolving the issue. The README provides a detailed explanation of the bug and its solution.  This scenario highlights the importance of carefully selecting unique keys when utilizing FlatList to ensure optimal performance and data integrity within your React Native applications.
